Assignments Luke gave
 
So the only other thing I can think of would be the wheel of ffortune style spinner we want to use somewhere in the site.
So I will Give that to Becky to head,and Liz/Joah, if you could support her.
I'm thinking: Liz/Joah, you guys will build the templates for t he site's theme
Joah/liz will work on a plugin to implement the fun "find the fish" challenge.
Monty/Sarah.Becky will learn how to style in CSS for "the Content" 
Sarah/Monty will create elements that Liz and Joah will implement in the theme
=======
This project is for a group of friends to learn new technologies and learn from each other skills. Some other reasons for this project:
 
* So that Luke can continue on his quest to design the internet.
 
* To help Liz learn about WordPress and who will most likely be wearing pink while doing it.
 
* So Sarah can start programming with her present and always ready attitude.
 
* Because Montana is a force to be reckoned with.
 
* And Joah, whose cleverness intimidates us all.
 
We hope to learn something and hopefully help add more female programmers to the ranks.
We are a rare and special breed...Especially Montana who I'm pretty sure if she tried hard enough could get even the wind to bend to her will.
