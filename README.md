So the only other thing I can think of would be the wheel of ffortune style spinner we want to use somewhere in the site.
So I will Give that to Becky to head,and Liz/Joah, if you could support her.
I'm thinking: Liz/Joah, you guys will build the templates for t he site's theme
Joah/liz will work on a plugin to implement the fun "find the fish" challenge.
Monty/Sarah.Becky will learn how to style in CSS for "the Content" 
Sarah/Monty will create elements that Liz and Joah will implement in the theme
